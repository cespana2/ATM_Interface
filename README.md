# ATM_Interface
ATM project which simulates an ATM interaction. I decided to go with this project becuase I wanted to see how an atm interaction works in the backend.
I wanted to code something which is used in the real world and tried to get something which could give me an insight on how a real coding task in the workplace could be. 

The program has 5 parts: 

### Account.java

This file contains all the parts for a user's bank account. The account consists of a list of transactions, the account name, account ID and the User. 

### AtmApp.java

This file runs the program. 

### Bank.java

This file holds all the Users that use the bank, the user's accounts and the name of the Bank.

### Transaction.java

This file holds all the User's account's transaction details. The transaction holds the amount of the transaction, the date of the transaction, a memo and the account in which th transaction was made. 

### User.java

This file holds the User's details. It contains the name of the user, their ID, their password stored as a MD5 hash and a list of their accounts.
